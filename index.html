            Hello, my name is Hans Chou. This is my first course at Harvard Extension School
            towards the Web Technologies Certificate. I'm from Taiwan originally, though
            I've long lost count of how many years I've been in the States. I have two
            adorable kids (see proof below), both of whom more intelligent (and better
            looking) than I. I spend all my time outside of work trying to get my son to
            speak Chinese in full sentences, spoon-feeding my daughter for she wouldn't take 
            to the bottle, convincing my son that there's more to life than LEGOs, and
            playing Darth Vader to my son's Luke Skywalker (in his version of the story they
            are the father-and-son team). I'm a total novice when it comes to Web design and
            programming -- clearly demonstrated by my feeble attempt at a Bio page.<br>
            <img src="images/hh_dd.jpg" alt="HH & DD" width="367" height="367"><br>
            I'm using ActiveState Komodo IDE for this class.<br><br>
            Oh, and this page (and the CSS) has been W3C-validated (click <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fp1.hanhan.biz%2F">here</a>).
